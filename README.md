This is an example Android Application, which interacts with the Chevereto API.

With it, your Users can upload images, which they choose in the gallery or take them with their camera, to your Installation of Chevereto.

###How To use it?
Open "Constants.java" and replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with the API Key of your Chevereto Installation.
